## üß≠ Loading States

- The main blog list shows skeleton placeholders while data is fetched from `/api/blog`.
	- Component: `Components/BlogCardSkeleton.jsx`
	- Usage: rendered by `Components/BlogList.jsx` when `loading === true`
	- Layout: widths match `BlogItem` cards (w-[330px] sm:w-[300px]) ensuring identical column count.
	- Animation: Tailwind `animate-pulse` (no extra dependencies).
